/**
 * COMPONENTS
 *
 * Component styles serve as the entry point for all component-level styles in 
 * the UI. Each component partial should be scoped, modular, and 
 * self-contained, promoting reusability and maintainability across the project.
 *
 * Included partials
 * - _buttons.scss : Styles for primary and seconary buttons
 * - _cta.scss     : Call-to-action elements including layout styles
 * - _cards.scss   : Modular card components for displaying project categories  
 *                   in a grid layout
 * - _slider.scss  : Styles for the project interactive slider
 *
 * This file should be imported after global and layout styles to ensure 
 * components can override foundational rules where needed.
