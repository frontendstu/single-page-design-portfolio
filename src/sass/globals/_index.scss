/** 
 * GLOBALS
 *
 * Globals styles apply universally across the project. These styles establish 
 * a consistent baseline including foundational elements such as resets, 
 * boilerplate structure, and font declarations.
 *
 * Included partials
 * - _reset.scss        : Resets browser default styles for consistency
 * - _fonts.scss        : Custom font-face declarations
 * - _boilerplate.scss  : Base HTML elements, body styles and default typography
 *
 * These styles are loaded early in the cascade and should not contain 
 * component-specific rules. They form the groundwork for the reset of the 
 * design system.
