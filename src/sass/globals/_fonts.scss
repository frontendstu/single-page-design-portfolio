/**
 * FONTS
 *
 * The fonts partial handles custom fonts imports for the project using the 
 * `font-face` mixin. It ensures that fonts are loaded efficiently and 
 * consistently across the UI.
 *
 * Font files are imported using `font-display: swap` for performance, and 
 * font-weights/styles are declared explicity for clarity and control.
 *
 * This file is imported early in the global layer to ensure fonts are 
 * available before layout and component styles are applied.
