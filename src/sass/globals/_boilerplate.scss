/**
 * BOILERPLATE
 *
 * This partial defines foundational element styles that apply globally across 
 * the project. These styles establish consistent visual defaults for key HTML 
 * elements using design tokens and utility mixins.
 *
 * Included styles
 * - `body`     : Applied base background, text colour, font, and line-height
 * - `a`        : Defines link colour, decoration, transitions, and 
 *                accessibility enhancements via hover, focus and outline mixins
 * - `.heading` : Utility class for consistent heading font weight and family, 
 *                font size and colour is defined when required
 * - `.sr-only` : Accessibility utility for visually hiding elements while  
 *                keeping them accessible to screen
 *
 * These styles are intended to complement the reset and abstract layers, 
 * providing a clean, accessible and token-driven baseline for the UI.
