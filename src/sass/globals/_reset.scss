/**
 * RESET
 *
 * A minimal CSS reset to establish a consistent and predicable baseline across 
 * browsers. This reset removes default spacing, normalises box sizing and 
 * ensures media and structual elements behave consistently.
 *
 * Included resets:
 * - Universal box-sizing set to border-box for layout consistency
 * - Margin, padding and font inheritance reset on all elements
 * - Sets `color-scheme: light` on html to support system themes
 * - Ensures body takes up full viewport height
 * - Media elements (img, video, svg, picture) are block-level and responsive
 * - Removes default list styles from <ul> and <ol> elements
 *
 * This reset is intentionally lightwight and designed to compliment 
 * boilerplate and component styles without having to introduce heavy-handed 
 * overrides.
