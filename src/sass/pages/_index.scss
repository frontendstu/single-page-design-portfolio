/**
 * PAGES
 *
 * Page specific styles act as the entry point for scoped styles that apply 
 * only to individual page templates or views. These styles are not intended to 
 * be reused across the UI and should remain tightly coupled to their 
 * respective pages for clarity and maintainability.
 *
 * Included partials:
 * - _home.scss : Custom styles for the homepage layout
 *
 * This file should be imported last in the main stylesheet, after base, 
 * layout, and component styles, to ensure page-level overrides take priority 
 * where needed.
