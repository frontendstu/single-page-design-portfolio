/**
 * LAYOUT
 *
 * Layout styles aggregates all layout-level partials that define the structual 
 * scaffolding of the UI. These styles control the positioning and flow of 
 * major page regions without applying component-specific design.
 *
 * Included partials:
 * - _header.scss       : Global site header layout and visual styles 
 * - _footer.scss       : Global site footer layout and visual styles
 * - _container.scss    : Wrapper and container utilities for consistent spacing
 *
 * Layouts styles should focus on structure and region-specific design not 
 * reusable components. They are intended to support and frame the content 
 * within the page.
 *
 * This file should be imported after global styles and before components.
