/**
 * SITE SCRIPTS
 * 
 * The site scripts contains all JavaScript functionality for the site, 
 * including UI interactions, component behaviour, and event handling. Scripts 
 * are written with performance and minimalism in mind, avoiding unnescessary 
 * bloat while enhancing usability and accessibility.
 * 
 * Where possible, functions should be modular and scoped to individual 
 * components or sections. Consider extracting logic into reusable utilities if 
 * complexity grows.
